Let’s take the concurrency tools we’ve explored—`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`, `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, and `CompletableFuture`—and compare them to JavaScript equivalents (or lack thereof) to help you understand them through a JS lens. Since JavaScript is single-threaded with an event-driven model, it doesn’t have direct analogs for Java’s multi-threaded tools, but we can draw parallels to its asynchronous patterns (like Promises, async/await, and event loops). I’ll keep it simple, use analogies, and tie it to Spring Boot/JS use cases—perfect for interviews and full-stack work. Here we go!

---

## 1. `ReentrantLock`
### What It Does in Java
- A lock ensuring only one thread accesses a resource at a time (exclusive access).
- Reentrant: The same thread can lock it multiple times without deadlocking.

### JS Equivalent
- **No Direct Match**: JS is single-threaded—no need for locks since only one thing runs at a time in the event loop.
- **Closest Concept**: Mutex-like behavior via Promises or flags in a single-threaded context.

### Comparison Example
#### Java with `ReentrantLock`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class CounterDemo {
    private int count = 0;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public void increment() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            count++;
            System.out.println("Count: " + count);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

#### JS Equivalent (Pseudo-Lock with Promise)
```javascript
let count = 0;
let isLocked = false;

async function increment() {
    while (isLocked) await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10)); // Spin wait
    isLocked = true;
    try {
        count++;
        console.log("Count: " + count);
    } finally {
        isLocked = false;
    }
}

increment(); increment();
```

### Key Differences
- **Java**: Multi-threaded, `ReentrantLock` prevents race conditions across threads.
- **JS**: Single-threaded, no race conditions unless using Web Workers. The “lock” simulates exclusivity in async flow.
- **Analogy**: Java’s like a bank vault with one key (`ReentrantLock`); JS is like a single cashier line—no one else can cut in.

**Spring Boot Use**: Rate limiting (exclusive counter updates).
**JS Use**: Sequential async task execution (e.g., Node.js queue).

## 2. `ReadWriteLock`
### What It Does in Java
- Splits into `readLock` (many can read) and `writeLock` (exclusive write), optimizing read-heavy scenarios.

### JS Equivalent
- **No Direct Match**: No multi-threaded reads/writes in JS.
- **Closest Concept**: Read/write coordination via async queues or state flags with Promises.

### Comparison Example
#### Java with `ReadWriteLock`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class CacheDemo {
    private String data = "Initial";
    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    public String read() {
        lock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            return data;
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    public void write(String newData) {
        lock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            data = newData;
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

#### JS Equivalent (Async Coordination)
```javascript
let data = "Initial";
let readers = 0;
let writing = false;

async function read() {
    while (writing) await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
    readers++;
    const result = data;
    readers--;
    return result;
}

async function write(newData) {
    while (readers > 0 || writing) await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
    writing = true;
    data = newData;
    writing = false;
}
```

### Key Differences
- **Java**: Multiple threads read concurrently, write blocks all. Hardware-level threading.
- **JS**: Single-threaded, simulates “readers” with counters and delays. Event loop manages order.
- **Analogy**: Java’s a library with many readers and one writer; JS is a single librarian juggling requests.

**Spring Boot Use**: In-memory cache (many reads, rare writes).
**JS Use**: Node.js app with shared state (e.g., in-memory DB reads/writes).

---

## 3. `CountDownLatch`
### What It Does in Java
- Waits for a set number of tasks to finish (one-time use) before proceeding.

### JS Equivalent
- **Closest Match**: `Promise.all()`—waits for multiple async tasks to resolve.

### Comparison Example
#### Java with `CountDownLatch`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class StartupDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);

        new Thread(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (Exception e) {}
            System.out.println("Task 1 done");
            latch.countDown();
        }).start();

        new Thread(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(150); } catch (Exception e) {}
            System.out.println("Task 2 done");
            latch.countDown();
        }).start();

        latch.await();
        System.out.println("All tasks done!");
    }
}
```

#### JS with `Promise.all()`
```javascript
async function startup() {
    const task1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Task 1 done");
        resolve();
    }, 100));

    const task2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Task 2 done");
        resolve();
    }, 150));

    await Promise.all([task1, task2]);
    console.log("All tasks done!");
}

startup();
```

### Key Differences
- **Java**: Multi-threaded, `countDown()` signals completion across threads.
- **JS**: Single-threaded, `resolve()` signals async completion in the event loop.
- **Analogy**: Java’s a referee waiting for 2 runners; JS is a waiter for 2 orders.

**Spring Boot Use**: Wait for service checks at startup.
**JS Use**: Wait for API calls in a Node.js app.

---

## 4. `CyclicBarrier`
### What It Does in Java
- Syncs a fixed number of threads at a barrier, reusable for multiple rounds.

### JS Equivalent
- **No Direct Match**: No multi-threaded sync points in JS.
- **Closest Concept**: Custom async coordination with Promises and a counter.

### Comparison Example
#### Java with `CyclicBarrier`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

public class SyncDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(2, () -> System.out.println("All synced!"));

        Runnable task = () -> {
            try {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " at barrier");
                barrier.await();
            } catch (Exception e) {}
        };

        new Thread(task).start();
        new Thread(task).start();
    }
}
```

#### JS Equivalent (Pseudo-Sync)
```javascript
let arrivals = 0;
const barrierSize = 2;
let resolveBarrier;

function syncPoint() {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        arrivals++;
        if (arrivals === barrierSize) {
            console.log("All synced!");
            resolveBarrier();
            arrivals = 0; // Reset for reuse
            resolveBarrier = null;
        } else if (!resolveBarrier) {
            resolveBarrier = resolve;
        }
    });
}

async function task(name) {
    console.log(name + " at barrier");
    await syncPoint();
}

task("Task-1"); task("Task-2");
```

### Key Differences
- **Java**: Threads wait at `await()`, multi-threaded sync.
- **JS**: Async tasks “wait” via Promises, single-threaded coordination.
- **Analogy**: Java’s cyclists at a checkpoint; JS is a chat group waiting for replies.

**Spring Boot Use**: Sync parallel tasks (e.g., matrix rows).
**JS Use**: Coordinate async steps in a workflow (e.g., Node.js pipeline).

---

## 5. `CompletableFuture`
### What It Does in Java
- Async task with result handling, chaining, and error recovery.

### JS Equivalent
- **Direct Match**: Promises with `.then()` and `.catch()` (as we discussed).

### Comparison Example
#### Java with `CompletableFuture`
```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class AsyncDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (Exception e) {}
            return "Data";
        });

        future.thenAccept(data -> System.out.println("Got " + data));
        System.out.println("Running...");
        Thread.sleep(150);
    }
}
```

#### JS with Promise
```javascript
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Data"), 100);
    });
}

console.log("Running...");
fetchData().then(data => console.log("Got " + data));
```

### Key Differences
- **Java**: Multi-threaded, can manually complete, richer API (`allOf`, `thenCompose`).
- **JS**: Event-loop based, simpler but less control over threads.
- **Analogy**: Both are food delivery—Java’s a multi-restaurant order; JS is a single chef.

**Spring Boot Use**: Async API calls or background tasks.
**JS Use**: Fetching data in a Node.js app.

## Spring Boot vs. JS Use Cases
| Tool               | Spring Boot Example                  | JS/Node.js Example                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `ReentrantLock`    | Rate limiter counter                | Sequential file writes              |
| `ReadWriteLock`    | In-memory cache reads/writes        | Async state management              |
| `CountDownLatch`   | Wait for service startup            | Wait for multiple API responses     |
| `CyclicBarrier`    | Sync parallel matrix computation    | Coordinate multi-step async process |
| `CompletableFuture`| Async API aggregation               | Promise-based data fetching         |

---

## Interview-Ready Summary
- **Locks**: “Java uses `ReentrantLock` and `ReadWriteLock` for thread safety; JS doesn’t need them due to its single-threaded nature—Promises simulate exclusivity.”
- **Latches/Barriers**: “`CountDownLatch` is like `Promise.all()` for one-time waits; `CyclicBarrier` has no direct JS match but mimics reusable async sync points.”
- **Futures**: “`CompletableFuture` mirrors JS Promises—async with chaining—but Java’s multi-threaded and more flexible.”

## Practice
Pick one (e.g., `ReadWriteLock`) and rewrite a JS async equivalent for a Node.js cache. See how they align! Clearer now? Want to zoom into one?
