Absolutely! Here's a clean and **interview-ready set of notes** for the **Singleton Design Pattern in Java**, just like the Adapter notes. These will help you **understand, revise, and recall** the Singleton pattern during interviews or while designing systems.

## üß† **Singleton Design Pattern ‚Äì Java Notes**

### ‚úÖ Definition:
Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to that instance.

### ‚úÖ Type:
- **Creational Design Pattern**

### ‚úÖ Intent:
> To restrict object creation so that only **one object** is created for the class, used repeatedly.

## üîå **Real-Life Analogies**
| Real-world Thing      | Singleton Role                                                               |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Government**        | Only one Prime Minister/President per country                                |
| **Logger**            | A single logging instance used throughout the application                    |
| **DB Connection Pool**| A single pool manages all DB connections                                     |
| **Print Spooler**     | Only one print spooler instance controls all print jobs                      |

## üß© **Java Implementation Styles**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Eager Initialization (Thread Safe)
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton instance = new Singleton();
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Lazy Initialization (Not Thread Safe)
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Thread-Safe Lazy Initialization (Synchronized)
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Double-Checked Locking (Best Practice)
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized(Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Singleton using Enum (Thread Safe + Serialization Safe)
```java
public enum Singleton {
    INSTANCE;
    public void doSomething() {
        // business logic
    }
}
```

## üîÅ When to Use?
- **Logging frameworks**
- **Configuration readers**
- **Caching, DB connection pools**
- **File systems**
- **Thread pools**
- **Managers/Controllers shared across modules**

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages
- Controlled access to single instance
- Reduces memory footprint
- Useful in shared resource management

## ‚ùå Disadvantages
- Makes unit testing harder (due to global state)
- Violates **Single Responsibility Principle** if logic is added
- Can lead to **hidden dependencies**

## üß™ Common Interview Questions

### ‚úÖ Conceptual:
1. What is Singleton Pattern and where is it used?
2. How do you implement a thread-safe Singleton in Java?
3. What is the difference between lazy and eager initialization?
4. How does the Enum Singleton solve issues of reflection and serialization?
5. Can reflection break Singleton? How?

### ‚úÖ Coding:
6. Write a thread-safe Singleton class.
7. Convert a class with multiple instantiations into Singleton.
8. Implement Singleton in a Spring Boot application (using `@Component` or `@Service`).

## üîÅ Quick Revision Hack

- Singleton = **Single object for entire app**
- Think: **"Only one CEO, only one DB connection pool"**
- Common errors: multiple instances via Reflection, Serialization ‚Äî solve using **Enum**

## üå± Where Java and Spring Use It

| Tech | Singleton Usage |
|------|------------------|
| **Spring Beans** | By default, Spring beans are Singleton scoped |
| **Log4j / SLF4J** | Logger classes are Singleton |
| **Hibernate SessionFactory** | Singleton |
| **Runtime.getRuntime()** | Classic Java Singleton |
| **Spring's ApplicationContext** | Singleton instance during app lifecycle |
