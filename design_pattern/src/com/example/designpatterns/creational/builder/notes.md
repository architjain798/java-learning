# 🧱 **Builder Design Pattern – Java Notes**

### ✅ Definition:
Builder pattern is used to construct a **complex object step by step**, separating construction logic from the object structure itself.

### ✅ Type:
- **Creational Design Pattern**

### ✅ Intent:
> To create complex objects with **multiple optional fields** or configurations **without writing telescoping constructors.**

---

## 🧠 Real-Life Analogies

| Real-world Example    | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Pizza Order**       | You choose base, sauce, toppings, size — step by step |
| **Resume Builder**    | Add experience, education, skills – one at a time |
| **Home Construction** | Build room by room (foundation, wall, roof) |

---

## 🧩 Problem it Solves

Without builder, you end up with **many constructors**:
```java
new User("John", "Doe");
new User("John", "Doe", 25);
new User("John", "Doe", 25, "john@gmail.com");
```

This becomes messy — **Builder pattern solves it**.

---

## 👨‍💻 Java Code Example

```java
class User {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private int age;
    private String email;

    private User(UserBuilder builder) {
        this.firstName = builder.firstName;
        this.lastName = builder.lastName;
        this.age = builder.age;
        this.email = builder.email;
    }

    public static class UserBuilder {
        private String firstName;
        private String lastName;
        private int age;
        private String email;

        public UserBuilder(String firstName, String lastName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }

        public UserBuilder age(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        public UserBuilder email(String email) {
            this.email = email;
            return this;
        }

        public User build() {
            return new User(this);
        }
    }
}
```

### ✅ Usage:
```java
User user = new User.UserBuilder("John", "Doe")
                    .age(28)
                    .email("john@example.com")
                    .build();
```

## 🛠 Where to Use:
- Complex constructors with **optional fields**
- Objects that are **immutable**
- Avoid constructor explosion (`new User(String, String, int, String...)`)
- Building **DTOs, Configs, Query Builders**

## 🔁 Builder vs Factory vs Constructor

| Feature        | Builder                          | Factory                       | Constructor       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| When to use    | Complex object with options       | Hide instantiation logic      | Simple instantiation |
| Object steps   | Step-by-step                      | All at once                   | All at once       |
| Reuse config   | Yes                               | Limited                       | No                |
| Immutability   | Easy to implement                 | Manual                        | Manual            |

## 🌱 Real-World Usage

| Framework / Tool     | Usage of Builder Pattern        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Lombok `@Builder`**| Auto generates builder pattern   |
| **StringBuilder**    | Appending strings in a chain     |
| **JPA CriteriaBuilder** | Building complex DB queries     |
| **Spring Boot API Response Builders** | Custom API Response objects |

## 💬 Interview Questions

### 🔹 Conceptual
1. What is the Builder Pattern?
2. How is it different from Factory?
3. Why do we need Builder when we have constructors?
4. When would you prefer Builder over Setter injection?

### 🔹 Coding
5. Build an immutable class with Builder.
6. Use Builder in a Spring Boot DTO or Response.
7. Refactor telescoping constructors using Builder.

---

## 📘 In Spring Boot REST APIs

You can use builder pattern to:
- Build **API response objects**:
```java
ResponseEntity.ok(
    ApiResponse.builder()
        .message("Success")
        .data(someData)
        .status(HttpStatus.OK.value())
        .build()
);
```

- Create **immutable DTOs or config objects**
- Write **test data builders** for unit tests

## 🔁 Quick Revision Hack

- Builder = "Step by step construction"  
- Think Pizza: choose crust, cheese, toppings  
- Prevents constructor hell  
- Great for DTOs, responses, config
